# hugo-theme-hackcss

A simple and super fast [hackcss](https://hackcss.egoist.moe/)-inspired theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

## Original work

This theme has been forked from comfusion/after-dark@eb12046eebed63660b17872c0d61708ddb3243e6.

I removed history of and before that commit because some previous commits included video
files and were just generally adding a lot to the size of this repository.

Most of the credits thus still belong to jhabdas.
Thanks for providing this work under the WTFPL, though. :)
